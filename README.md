# MultiMedia Project

This project required the creation of an image retrieval pipeline using an __autoencoder__ deep learning architecture to extract features from the __CIFAR10__ data set. The size of the latent space was set to 10 neurons and build an autoencoder architecture such that maximum features can be learned in the limited latent space.

P.S.: The bonus part of the assignment was not covered in this assignment.
